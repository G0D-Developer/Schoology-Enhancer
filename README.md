## How to use Schoology Enhancer 

```Step 1:``` Install a local javascript injector, I personally recommend [Codify](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codify-the-code-adder/fdhkolbghmfidicmkaidnhpjcoeafojl?hl=en-GB)

```Step 2:``` Click on the extension and in the "Add Code" tab, copy and paste the code located in [Script.js](https://github.com/X-Developer-Studios/Schoology-Enhancer/blob/main/script.js)

```Step 3:``` Make sure the Url Match contains the text "henrico.schoology.com"

```Step 4:``` Click "Assign Code to Page" and you're almost done!

```Step 5:``` Install [Styler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bogdgcfoocbajfkjjolkmcdcnnellpkb), a local CSS injector

```Step 6:``` Click on the extension and copy/past [style.css's](https://github.com/X-Developer-Studios/Schoology-Enhancer/blob/main/style.css) contents into the first box and make sure your url bar displays "henrico.schoology.com"
